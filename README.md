To build yourself, ensure you install ollama executable first:

```bash
just install_ollama
```

### Dist folder

## Development

This command will run Svelte first which will start the vite dev server. Then it will compile the rust code, and start the Tauri dev server:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
# or using just.systems:
just tauri
```
